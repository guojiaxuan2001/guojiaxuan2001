### 👋 Hi, I’m Jiaxuan Guo

I'm a self-taught developer currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Systems (EEIS) at The University of Tokyo. My journey into computer science began outside the classroom — driven by curiosity, challenges, and a desire to build meaningful systems.

🔧 **Interests**  
- Platform Engineering ・ Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)  
- Cloud Infrastructure ・ DevOps 
- AI for Science ・ Electrical Market & Energy Systems

🧠 I transitioned from Environmental Engineering (B.Eng, 2024) to EEIS (which is similar to an ECE major) out of a strong curiosity for technology. I'm passionate about building systems that work — from backend services to infrastructure tools — and I aspire to become a highly skilled developer who creates meaningful impact through code.
