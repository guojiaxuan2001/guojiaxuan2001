### 👋 Hi, I’m Jiaxuan Guo

I'm a self-taught developer currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Systems at the University of Tokyo. My journey into computer science began outside the classroom — driven by curiosity, challenges, and a desire to build meaningful systems.

🔧 **Interests**  
- Platform Engineering ・ Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)  
- Cloud Infrastructure ・ DevOps & Automation  
- AI for Science ・ Research-oriented Applications

🧠 I transitioned from Environmental Engineering (B.Eng, 2024) to systems & computing by self-studying programming, system design, and cloud technologies. Along the way, I’ve built tools, services, and backend systems — and I’m just getting started.

📚 Always learning. Always building. Always iterating.
